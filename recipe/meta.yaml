  description: |
    GFAL (Grid File Access Library) is a C library providing an abstraction
    layer of the grid storage system complexity. The version 2 of GFAL tries to
    simplify at the maximum the file operations in a distributed environment.
    The complexity of the grid is hidden from the client side behind a simple
    common POSIX API. GFAL2 is able to manage all the common used file access
    protocols in a grid & cloud environment.
